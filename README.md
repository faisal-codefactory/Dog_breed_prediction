# Dog_breed_prediction
The implementation uses pre-trained CNN and transfer learning to develop a Dog_breed_prediction model. The notebook branch contains the jupyter notebook for model developed by transfer learning over mobilenet. This model is able to predict all 120 classes of dog breeds with 72% accuracy. This model can be further enchanced by longer training.

The main branch contains a streamlit app with subset model (without transfer learning), which is able to predict three dog classes ['Scottish Deerhound','Maltese Dog','Bernese Mountain Dog'] only.
